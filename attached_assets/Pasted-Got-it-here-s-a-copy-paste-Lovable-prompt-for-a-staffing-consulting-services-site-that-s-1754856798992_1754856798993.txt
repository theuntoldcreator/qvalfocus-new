# Prompt (Lovable AI): Build a Fancy Staffing + Consulting Website (Next.js + TS)

**Goal**
Create a premium, image-forward **Staffing + Consulting + Services** website for **{{CompanyName}}** that feels modern and fancy, with smooth micro-interactions, strong visuals, and conversion-focused CTAs. Generate a full **Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind** project, production-ready.

## Brand & Style

* Visual vibe: sleek enterprise + creative agency (think subtle glassmorphism, soft gradients, big imagery, tasteful parallax).
* Motion: smooth hover states, section fade/slide reveals, marquee logos, counters; keep performance high.
* Imagery: diverse, professional photos of teams, offices, collaboration, tech; include an **image-rich hero** on every major page.
* Color: primary {{PrimaryColor}}, accent {{AccentColor}}, neutral background; support dark mode toggle.
* Typography: modern sans for UI, elegant serif for headlines (fallbacks defined).
