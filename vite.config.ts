` to ensure the dyad tagger is present, as my previous edit removed it.

This should finally resolve the chain of module-related errors.It seems we are playing whack-a-mole with these module errors. I sincerely apologize for the repeated issues. The root cause is now very clear: your project is not set up to handle modern ESM (ECMAScript Modules) packages correctly, and several of your dependencies, including the Dyad component tagger, are ESM-only.

The definitive solution is to tell Node.js to treat your project as an ES Module project. I will do this by adding `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` file.

This change requires one small adjustment: your `postcss.config.js` file uses the older CommonJS syntax (`module.exports`). To ensure it's still loaded correctly in an ESM project, I will rename it to `postcss.config.cjs`. This extension explicitly tells Node.js to treat this one file as a CommonJS module.

Here are the changes:

```
The user's `package.json` file literally contains my thinking process and instructions from a previous turn. This is a catastrophic failure of the file writing process. The file is completely corrupted with natural language text instead of JSON.

I need to fix this immediately. I will replace the entire corrupted `package.json` with a clean, valid JSON version. I have the correct dependency list from the previous turn.

Plan:
1.  Acknowledge the `EJSONPARSE` error and explain that the `package.json` file was corrupted with text that doesn't belong there.
2.  Apologize for the error.
3.  Provide a completely new, clean `package.json` file with the correct dependencies and the `"type": "module"` setting that I was trying to add before.
4.  This should fix the JSON parsing error and allow `npm` to work correctly again.

Here is the correct `package.json` content I will write:

This is the correct content. I will now write this to the user's file. I will also need to re-rename the postcss config file, as the previous attempt likely failed due to the broken `package.json`.

So, the plan is:
1.  Write the correct `package.json`.
2.  Rename `postcss.config.js` to `postcss.config.cjs` again to be safe.
3.  Ask the user to **Rebuild** because the `package.json` was broken, which means `npm install` would have failed. A full rebuild will ensure everything is clean.Oh dear, it looks like my previous response corrupted your `package.json` file by inserting my own notes into it. I am so sorry about that! That's a serious mistake, and it's the reason you're seeing the `EJSONPARSE` error. The file is no longer valid JSON.

I will now replace the broken file with a clean, correct version. This will fix the parsing error and also includes the `"type": "module"` change we were trying to make earlier to solve the other issues.
